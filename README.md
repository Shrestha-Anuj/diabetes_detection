The dataset is a secondary dataset which is first made a dirty dataset to use and test different preprocessing techniques.
Dirty dataset is then converted into a clean and relavant dataset.
Feature selection is performed to get the principal components using pearson's correlation method.
Then supervised machine learning algorithm - decision tree was used to built a model that can predict whether a person has diabetes or not.
Tensorflow was used to check the performance of the decision tree using Confusion matrix methods.
